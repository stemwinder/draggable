Draggable
==============================

Draggable adds drag and drop sorting to custom channel fields, member fields, statuses, and categories in the [ExpressionEngine](http://www.expressionengine.com) control panel.

## Installation

To install Draggable:

1. Copy the `/draggable/` folder to your `/system/expressionengine/third_party/` folder.
2. Navigate to "Add-Ons" > "Extensions", then click the "Enable?" link to the right of the Draggable extension listing.
3. Make sure "install" is selected for both the Accessory and the Extension and click "Submit"

Once installed, you'll be able to sort entries on the custom channel fields, member fields, statuses, and categories pages by dragging and dropping the table rows. Row order is saved automatically when you drop the row in its new position.
